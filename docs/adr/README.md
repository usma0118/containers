# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting important
design decisions for this repository.

Conventions

- Files are named with a zero-padded sequence number and short slug, for example `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`.
- Use `Status` values: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`.
- Keep ADRs concise: Context, Decision, Consequences.

Workflow

1. Copy an existing ADR and increment the number (e.g., `0002-your-decision.md`).
2. Update `Date`, `Status`, `Context`, `Decision`, and `Consequences` sections.
3. Open a PR describing the ADR and request review from the appropriate reviewers.

See `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md` for an example and template.
